== E.1 ISA Programme Location Core Vocabulary (LOCN)

LOCN Source: https://www.w3.org/ns/locn

The LOCN specification provides notes on the use of GeoSPARQL literals (see https://www.w3.org/ns/locn#changes).

|===
| From Element | Mapping relation | To Element | Notes

| `geo:Feature` | `rdfs:subClassOf` | `dcterms:Location` | LOCN states that `dcterms:Location` "represents any location, irrespective of size or other restriction". As such, it can be considered as a superclass of `geo:Feature`. 
| `locn:Address` | `rdfs:subClassOf` | `geo:Feature` | Although LOCN does not explicitly indicate spatial or geometry properties for `locn:Address`, this class can be considered as a specialized form of a `geo:Feature`.
| `geo:Geometry` | `rdfs:subClassOf` | `locn:Geometry` | In LOCN, class `locn:Geometry` "[...] defines the notion of geometry at the conceptual level, and it shall be encoded by using different formats". More precisely, its instances can be either literals or individuals. The GeoSPARQL's class `geo:Geometry` is more narrowly defined, as its instances can only be individuals, and not literals.
| `geo:hasGeometry` | `rdfs:subPropertyOf` | `locn:geometry` | In LOCN, the usage note to property `locn:geometry` states that "Depending on how a geometry is encoded, the range of this property may be one of the following: a literal [...], an instance of a geometry class [...], geocoded URIs [...]". The GeoSPARQL's property `geo:hasGeometry` is more narrowly defined, as it can only be used with instances of `geo:Geometry`, and not with literals.

== E.5 Juso Ontology

Juso Source: http://rdfs.co/juso/

Juso contains mappings to GeoSPARQL but uses `owl:sameAs` which it should instead use `owl:equivalentClass`.

== E.6 Time Ontology in OWL (TIME)

TIME Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/

There are no direct class or property correspondences between GeoSPARQL and TIME however class patterning is similar:

* TIME uses `time:hasTime` to indicate that something has a temporal projection
* GeoPSARQL uses `geo:hasGeometry` to indicate that a `geo:Feature` has a spatial projection

and

* TIME uses properties such as `time:inXSDDate` to indicate the position of temporal entities on a temporal reference system
* GeoSPARQL uses properties such as `geo:asWKT` to indicate the position of spatial entities (Geometries) on spatial reference systems

OWL TIME sets no domain for `time:hasTime` thus this property may be used with anything, including a GeoSPARQL `geo:Feature` so that a spati-temporal Feature may be indicated like this:

```turtle
:flooded-area-x
    a geo:Feature ;
    geo:hasGeometry [
        a geo:Geometry ;
        geo:asWKT "POLYGON (((...)))"^^geo:wktLiteral ;
    ] ;
    time:hasTime [
        a time:ProperInterval ;
        time:hasBeginning [
            time:inXSDDate "..."^^xsd:date ;
        ] ;
        time:hasEnd [
            time:inXSDDate "..."^^xsd:date ;
        ] ;        
    ] ;
.    
```

In the above example, `:flooded-area-x` is a spatio-temporal Feature that has both a GeoSPARQL spatial projection - a `geo:Geometry` - and a temporal projection - a `time:ProperInterval` which is a specailised form of `time:TemporalEntity`.

Another possible use of TIME with GeoSPARQL is to assign temporality to individual `geo:Geometry` instances. This is allowed given `time:hasTime`'s open domain:


```turtle
:flooded-area-x
    a geo:Feature ;
    geo:hasGeometry [
        a geo:Geometry ;
        geo:asWKT "POLYGON (((...)))"^^geo:wktLiteral ;
        time:hasTime [ ... ] ;      
    ] ;
.
```

In contrast to the first example, `:flooded-area-x` is inferred to be a spatio-temporal Feature but since it is the Geometry of `:flooded-area-x` that has a temporality, it is possible to describe other Geometries of `:flooded-area-x` with other temporalities.

| `geo:Geometry` | `rdfs:subClassOf` | `sdo:GeoShape` | A GeoShape can various literal geometry representation

| `sdo:GeoCoordinates` | `rdfs:subClassOf` | `geo:Geometry` | GoCoordinates uses direct lat, long, elevation etc properties to indicate position, not a while geometry serialization but it is nevertheless a form of a Geometry

== E.8 Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (SSN)

SSN Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/

SSN and GeoSPARQL do not cover overlapping concerns directly and therefore there are no direct class or property correspondences between them, however SSN provides advice on the use of GeoSPARQL for location, 
see Section 7.1 (https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#x7-1-location):

> GeoSPARQL ... provides a flexible and relatively complete platform for geospatial objects, that fosters interoperability between geo-datasets. To do so, these entities can be 
declared as instances of geo:Feature and geometries can be assigned to them via the geo:hasGeometry property. In case of classes, e.g., specific features of interests such as 
rivers, these can be defined as subclasses of geo:Feature.


== E.9 DCMI Metadata Terms (DCTERMS)

DCTERMS Source: https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/

|===
| From Element | Mapping relation | To Element | Notes

| `geo:Feature` | `rdfs:SubClassOf` | `dcterms:Location` | A Location is a "A spatial region or named place."
| `dcterms:coverage` | - | - | See note below table
| `dcterms:spatial` - | - | Since coverage is a sub property of `dcterms:coverage`
|===

`dcterms:coverage` is extremely generic - "The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, spatial applicability of the resource, or jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant." - but DCTERMS indicates its range includes a `dcterms:Location`, so it is a property for indicating a `geo:Feature`, not a `geo:Geometry` and for which GeoSPARQL has no equivalent. Often, `dcterms:coverage` is used to indicate a spatial extent such as a bounding box. GeoSPARQL now provides a `geo:hasBoundingBox` property, so such a property could be used if a Bounding Box is wanted to be indicated.

DCTERMS-related geometry literals, such as the _DCMI Box Encoding Scheme_footnote:[https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-box/] and the _DCMI Point Encoding Scheme_footnote:[https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-point/] 
could be indicated as GeoSPARQL geometry literals if a literal datatype were created for each. For example, the _DCMI Point Encoding Scheme_ example of "The highest point in Australia" with the literal value 
`east=148.26218; north=-36.45746; elevation=2228; name=Mt. Kosciusko` might be encoded in GeoSPARQL like this:

```turtle
:mt-kosciusko
    a geo:Feature ;
    geo:hasGeometry [
        a geo:Geometry ;
        geo:hasSerialization "east=148.26218; north=-36.45746; elevation=2228; name=Mt. Kosciusko"^^ex:dcmiPoint ;        
    ] ;
.
```


== E.10 The Provenance Ontology (PROV)

PROV Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/

From GeoSPARQL's point of view, PROV is an "upper" ontology - one dealing with more abstract concepts - and only one of PROV's three main classes of object, `Entity`, `Activity` & `Agent` has direct relations to GeoSPARQL classes: `Entity`.

|===
| From Element | Mapping relation | To Element | Notes

| `geo:SpatialObject` | `rdfs:subClassOf` | `prov:Entity` | All SpatialObjects fit within PROV's Entity's definition: "An entity is a physical, digital, conceptual, or other kind of thing with some fixed aspects; entities may be real or imaginary." 
| `geo:Feature` | `rdfs:subClassOf` | `prov:Location` | A Location "...can be an identifiable geographic place (ISO 19112), but it can also be a non-geographic place such as a directory, row, or column" so seem to be wider in scope than GeoSPARQL's Feature although a Feature could indeed be something such as a "directory, row, or column"
| `prov:atLocation` | - | - | The PROV property indicates a `prov:Location`, so perhaps a `geo:Feature`, but GeoSPARQL has no property to indicate a `geo:Feature`
|===

Derivative relations between GeoSPARQL objects could be modelled using PROV, for instance a BoundingBox may be indicated as haveing been derived from a Polygon like this:

```turtle
:bounding-box-y prov:wasDerivedFrom :polygon-x .
```

== E.11 WikiData

|===
| From Element | Mapping relation | To Element | Notes 
| `wdt:P625` | `owl:equivalentProperty` | `geo:asWKT` | The Wikidata description of this property labeled "coordinate location" note that "For Earth, please note that only WGS84 coordinating system is supported at the moment" but that is a system limit, not an ontological one
| `wdt:P3896`   | `owl:propertyChainAxiom` | `(geo:hasGeometry geo:asGeoJSON)` | This Wikidata property labeled "geoshape" indicated GeoJSON geomettry literal content for a Feature, but it allows information other than just Geometry in the GeoJSON whereas GeoSPARQL does not.
| `wdt:P3096`  | `owl:propertyChainAxiom` | `(geo:hasGeometry geo:asKML)` | This Wikidata property labeled "KML File" links to a KML file which is related to the respective instance. This may not be the same representation as in GeoSPARQL, as GeoSPARQL KML literals only encode the geometry part of a KML.
| `wd:Q82794`  | `rdfs:subClassOf` | `geo:Feature` | The Wikidata class is labeled "geographic region" and thus is a subclass of the more general `geo:Feature`. There are likely many other classes in Wikidata that could be interpreted as subclasses of `geo:Feature`
| `wd:Q618123`  | `owl:equivalentClass` | `geo:Feature` | The Wikidata class is labeled "geographical feature" and thus corresponds to `geo:Feature`.
| `wd:Q25404640`  | `owl:equivalentClass` | `geo:SpatialObject` | The Wikidata class is labeled "spatial object" and thus corresponds to `geo:SpatialObject`.
| `wdt:P150` | `rdfs:subPropertyOf` | `geo:sfContains` | The Wikidata property is labeled "contains administrative territorial entity" but also alternatively labeled "contains", "has districts" and others. There are likely many other specialised forms of `geo:sfContains` and `geo:sfWithin` in Wikidata
| `geo:sfWithin` | `rdfs:subPropertyOf` | `wdt:P361` | The Wikidata property is labeled "part of" and is sometimes used to indicate Feature parthood. There are likley other parthood properties like this in Wikipedia that may also be used as superproperties of GeoSPARQL feature relations properties. The Wikidata inverse is `wdt:Q65964571` "has part"
| `geo:sfContains` | `rdfs:subPropertyOf` | `wd:Q65964571`   | The property labeled "has part" is the inverse of `wdt:P361` (see above)
| `wdt:P131`  | `rdfs:subPropertyOf` | `geo:sfContains` | The Wikidata property is labeled "located in the administrative territorial entity" and is essentially the inverse of `wdt:150` (described above)
| `wdt:P706` | `rdfs:subPropertyOf` | `geo:sfWithin` | The Wikidata property is labeled "located in/on physical feature" and is indicated for use with a "(geo)physical feature" and not to be used for administrative features where `wdt:131` (see above) should be
| `wdt:P4688` | `rdfs:subClassOf` | `geo:Feature` | The Wikidata class is labeled "geomorphological unit" and is one of many Wikidata feature classes that could be expressed as a subclass of `geo:Feature`. More specailised geological unit examples are `Q5107` "continent" and `wdt:P4552` "mountain range".
| `wdt:P2046` | `owl:equivalentProperty` | `geo:hasArea` | The Wikidata property is labeled "area". It indicates a microformat - NUMBER + SPACE + ALLOWED_UNIT_LABEL - with a fixed set of ALLOWED_UNIT_LABELs to present values and units of measure.
