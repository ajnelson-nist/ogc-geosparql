== Introduction

=== Scope

The OGC GeoSPARQL standard supports representing and querying geospatial data on the Semantic Web. GeoSPARQL defines a vocabulary for representing geospatial data in RDF, and it defines extensions to the SPARQL query language for processing geospatial data. 

Version 1.1 of GeoSPARQL was released approximately 9 years after version 1.0. It contains no breaking changes to 1.0, but does contain additions: whole new profile resources, new ontology elements and new functions.
